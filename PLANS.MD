# Action Jackson Installs  
## Business Plan Overview

# 1. Service Packages & Pricing Strategy

## Positioning

**Smart networking and automation upgrades for builder-grade homes.**  
Not just cable runs. Not just mounting cameras.  
Engineered, segmented, performance-focused home infrastructure.

Ethernet drops are offered — but they are not the brand.

---

## Pricing Philosophy

- Charge for expertise and system design, not hourly labor.
- Bundle configuration into packages.
- Mark up hardware 15–25%.
- Keep standalone drops competitive but not race-to-bottom.
- Increase pricing when consistently booked 3–4 weeks out.
